# NLtoSQL-AI: Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

## Project Overview
NLtoSQL-AI is an advanced AI-powered tool that translates natural language questions into optimized SQL queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with databases using everyday language. This project leverages cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between human communication and database querying.

## üåü Key Features (Planned)
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process and understand complex human language queries
- **SQL Generation**: Convert natural language to syntactically correct SQL for multiple database systems
- **Query Optimization**: Generate efficient SQL queries with performance considerations
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain conversation context for follow-up questions
- **Schema Understanding**: Automatically analyze and understand database schemas
- **Multi-dialect Support**: Generate SQL for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more
- **Explainability**: Provide explanations of generated SQL queries
- **API Access**: RESTful API for integration with existing tools

## üöÄ Project Status
This project is currently in the early development phase. I am actively working on:
- Researching optimal NLP models for text-to-SQL conversion
- Designing the system architecture
- Building the training data pipeline
- Developing the core NLP processing engine

## üîç Technical Approach
NLtoSQL-AI uses a hybrid approach combining:
1. **Large Language Models**: Fine-tuned transformer models for understanding complex queries
2. **Semantic Parsing**: Converting natural language to intermediate representations
3. **SQL Generation Engine**: Transforming semantic representations into optimized SQL
4. **Database Schema Analyzer**: Incorporating database structure into the query generation

## üìä Use Cases
- Business analysts accessing data without SQL knowledge
- Data democratization within organizations
- Simplified database querying for research and education
- Integration with existing BI tools and dashboards
- Reducing the technical barriers to data access

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: For machine learning components
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For NLP model implementation
- **SQLGlot/SQLParse**: For SQL parsing and analysis
- **FastAPI**: For API development
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment

## üóìÔ∏è Roadmap
See [ROADMAP.md](./roadmap.md) for the detailed development plan.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About the Developer
This project is being developed by Giri Merugu as part of an entrepreneurial self-employment venture during OPT (Optional Practical Training). The work directly relates to my academic background in Data Science and professional experience in NLP and AI.
